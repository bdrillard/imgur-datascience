# imgur-datascience

A project using Clojure to acquire and analyze (thankfully) structured data from the somewhat notorious User Sub gallery of [Imgur.com]. We attempt to identify relationships between various attributes of the submission (submission time, content, etc) and the viability of the image, i.e., its ability to generate "fake internet points" for its submitter.
